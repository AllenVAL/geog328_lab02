  <h2>History and Origin</h2>
 <p>
    The <b>balisong</b>, also known as the butterfly knife, originated in the Philippines and is believed to have been first made in the province of Batangas in the early 20th century.
    Traditional craftsmen used simple tools to forge each knife by hand, passing their techniques from generation to generation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The word “balisong” comes from the Tagalog words <i>baling</i> (to break) and <i>sungay</i> (horn), referring to the early versions that used carved animal horn for handles.
    Over time, it became not only a utility tool but also a cultural symbol that represented Filipino creativity, craftsmanship, and self-reliance.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the 1900s, American soldiers who were stationed in the Philippines brought balisongs back home, helping spread their popularity overseas.
    Later, they became featured in movies and martial arts demonstrations, where the quick flipping motion made them look both skillful and artistic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although modern laws restrict their use in many countries, balisongs remain an important part of Philippine heritage and knife-making history.
    Today, collectors and enthusiasts continue to value the handmade quality of traditional Batangas-style balisongs.
