## 🌐 Project Overview
This project is part of **GEOG 328: Web Mapping**.  
In Lab 2, I learned how to build a **responsive website** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The goal was to convert my previous Lab 1 wiki page into a working website that adjusts to different screen sizes.

The website topic is **"The Art of the Balisong"**, which introduces the Filipino butterfly knife — its history, design, and modern culture.
